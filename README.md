## Descriptions: ##
**Tech Stack**: We use React for the frontend, and the backend is implemented with Django. 

This is a course recommendation website that integrates GPT, YouTube, and other features to provide users with better experiences in looking up the classes compared to GOLD. Students can get recommended classes from all the departments by entering the topics they like. They can see the class information,  the ratings for their instructors, and the grade distribution of this professor in the previous quarter. Students can also search for the names of the professors they like and see if they teach any classes this quarter.

 ## User Roles:

* **Students** that consider which courses to take in the next quarter and need help managing their courses.
* **Maintainers** that need to modify the courses& courses' descriptions and other information listed on the website.
