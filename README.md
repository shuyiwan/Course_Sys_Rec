## Descriptions: ##
**Tech Stack**: We use React for the frontend, and the backend is implemented with Django. 

This web app aims to help student to pick the right course and succeed later in the class. Students can enter the course titles and see the detailed descriptions of the class.They can also typed in keywords and get a series of class relevent to these topics. When the class begins, they can use this web to find a summary of topics to help them organize the materials and prepare for exams. It can recommend others courses that students may want to take in the following quarters based on their courses history. 

 ## User Roles:

* **Students** that consider which courses to take in the next quarter and need help managing their courses.
* **Maintainers** that need to modify the courses& courses' descriptions and other information listed on the website.
