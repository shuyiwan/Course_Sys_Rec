# RETRO_01.md

## 1/26/24

**Led by:** Claire Pemberton  
**Present:** Ivan, Mariana, Shuyi, Yicong, Kevin, Katz, Leo (Everyone)  
**Absent:** None  
**Link to Retro:** [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1YWlQY=/?share_link_id=787305438325)

## Action Item

**A goal:**  
Make sure we stay on track with the proposed timeline so none of us fall behind, and help team members that are at risk of falling behind.

**A change/experiment:**  
Have a weekly to-do list that we can customize throughout the week and make sure we finish this on time.

**A measurement:**  
Monitor the issues and determine if we are successfully meeting deadlines.

**Optional:**  
Many of us want to gain experience in both back-end and front-end, so we should remember this and try to move roles around and/or implement buddy learning groups so that we can all gain extra knowledge/experience in both areas.

## Retro Assessment

I used a Miro board because I thought it would be helpful to collaborate on one document at the same time with sticky notes. I used multiple templates: Start/Stop/Continue, What/So What?/Now what?, and Liked/Learned/Lacked/Longed for. We skipped What/So What?/Now what?

Overall, I think it went well, and we were able to discuss different ideas and come up with an action plan. However, it was a little rough at first because there is a slight learning curve with the Miro tools. Long term, I think the tool is super helpful, especially because it is designed around agile development and actually has pre-made retrospective templates which I used and modified slightly.

I also think I could have done a better job facilitating the meeting. There were some moments of silence where the discussion was slightly less organized. I also made a few different activities for the retro, but I think this could have been separated, especially for the first retro, so it was a bit more structured. I do think the activities I made have value, so maybe we can do the ones we didn’t get to when they are more relevant in a few weeks. I do feel like the sticky note method is productive because it allows everyone to have a voice. We just have to tweak the few things I mentioned for the next retros.

Based on what I learned, I would recommend the next retro leader prepares guiding questions in addition to the retro template. Because this is a time for you to listen, think about your answers to the template questions in advance and then develop leading questions that could be used to guide the conversation if it becomes stagnant. Also, maybe do some background research to gain an understanding of some of the technical skills required by certain tasks your teammates are completing. We all have different skill sets and experience levels, but as a leader, it’s important to have a broad understanding of the technical aspects of the individual components of a product, since you are responsible for those components successfully integrating together.

## Experiment/Change

The one Stop we had in Start/Stop/Continue was that we need to stop assigning issues on Wednesday. Instead, we should plan ahead and have issues delegated at the beginning of the week. That way, we are prepared and have time to ask questions if necessary before the deadline. This ensures that we produce quality work instead of rushing.

We implemented this change on Monday, and I think it has made our team function better. We’ve been able to have more discussions surrounding the issues and how we need to work together to make each component work. This change gave us an extra few days to have these important conversations and delegate roles.

We are going to keep this change. We also talked about doing code reviews earlier, and this change helps us accomplish this goal. In addition, we wanted to make sure that we have a weekly to-do list and that we can customize it as needed to ensure all the tasks get finished in time. This is something that goes hand-in-hand with our change, and overall, we are a lot more organized and clear on roles and responsibilities since we’ve started assigning issues early in the week.
